Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Hi Everyone.In this project I have made a website The Odisha  In which  I have made 4 different  HTML pages "index.html", "Food.html", "Places.html", and "culture.html"  to link all page i have used hyperlinks in the navbar  and  i have also linked youtube with image click and for designing I have used Bootstrap, SASS and almost all CSS functions and selector property including #id, .class selectors which I Learned in first 2 lectures. With the help of sass, I have created two CSS stylesheets. One is "style.css" and second is "Nested-inheritance.css”
In "style.scss" I have used $color as variable. In this stylesheet  I have also used @media query for the mobile responsive screen.
In "inher-heritance.scss" I have used both nesting and inheritance function of SASS.
I have used Bootstrap for the navbar and also used bootstrap grid album model as my bottom navigation menu. Thats it. Thankyou.
