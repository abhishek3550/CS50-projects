Hi, I'm Abhishek Singh and this is my project0   In this project I have made a website for Odisha Tourism In this project I have made 4 different  HTML pages "index.html", "Food.html", "Places.html", and "culture.html"  to link all page I have used hyperlinks in the navbar and for designing I have used Bootstrap, SASS and almost all CSS functions and selector property including #id, .class selectors which I Learned in first 2 lectures. With the help of sass, I have created two CSS stylesheets. One is "style.css" and second is "inher-heritance.css".
In "style.scss" I have used $color as variable. In this stylesheet  I have also used @media query for the mobile responsive screen.
In "inher-heritance.scss" I have used both nesting and inheritance function of SASS.
I have used Bootstrap for the navbar and also used bootstrap grid album model as my bottom navigation menu. That's all about my first project for video please go through below youtube link.
